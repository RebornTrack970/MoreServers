# More Servers

**What is "More Servers"?**

- Its a simple mod that basicaly adds more servers to your ingame global server list for you to enjoy!


**How can i add my server?**
- Simply, copy the js code that adds the server
- Code:  "Vars.defaultServers.add(new ServerGroup("Group name here", ["Server IP Here"]));"
- Then paste it after the previous code, change the ip and group and make a pr.

***Also, keep in mind that me (RTOmega) has no responsibility over what happens inside the servers as i have no control over them. Thus, this mod uses js so it may not work on all clients.***


**Server requirements:**
- Make it have a name
- Dont make duplicate groups or ips
- Make sure your server actualy works
- Your server can be modded or not but please make it obvious if it is infact modded.
- Please for gods sake, have less than 1000ms ping
- Add the servers owners name under the **Servers** section  under here \\/ + add what server the owner owns.

**Servers:**
- RTOmega - BetaMindy-Server
- Unjown - Braindustry
- TheDimas - Dimas server
- Volas171 - o7 anarchy server
